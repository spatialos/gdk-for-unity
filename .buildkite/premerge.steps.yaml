# Generated by <circle ci pipeline new>; this file *should* be edited manually to add or modify steps.
#
# Steps are executed based on the version in version control, and so you *do not* need to upload changes to BuildKite, just
#  commit them and send a PR to GitHub as you normally would.
#
# You may find the example pipeline steps listed here helpful: https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/defining-steps#example-pipeline but please
#  note that the setup is already done, so you should not manually adjust anything through the BuildKite interface.
