The SpatialOS Game Development Kit (GDK) for Unity allows you to quickly and easily build and host Unity multiplayer games. These games can use multiple server-side game engines across one seamless world to create new kinds of gameplay.

The GDK is composed of three layers:

**The GDK Core:** a performant, data-oriented integration with our cloud platform SpatialOS, based on the familiar Unity-native workflows.

**The GDK Feature Modules:** a library of solutions for hard or common networked game development problems, such as Character Movement and Shooting.

**The GDK Starter Projects:**
* A [**First Person Shooter (FPS) Starter Project**](https://github.com/spatialos/gdk-for-unity-fps-starter-project/) that enables you and your friends to experience the true scale of SpatialOS, providing a solid foundation for entirely new games.
* A [**Blank Starter Project**](https://github.com/spatialos/gdk-for-unity-blank-project) containing the minimum GDK feature set you need to start developing games for SpatialOS.

[Get started](https://docs.improbable.io/unity/alpha/content/get-started/get-started) with the SpatialOS GDK for Unity, by setting up the FPS Starter Project.
