The SpatialOS Game Development Kit (GDK) for Unity allows you to quickly and easily build and host Unity multiplayer games. These games can use multiple server-side game engines across one seamless world to create new kinds of gameplay.

This is the repository for the last version of the GDK plugin that is compatible with the SpatialOS legacy platform. The GDK is frozen for users who have not yet migrated their project to SpatialOS running on zeuz.

* If you have a current project using SpatialOS GDK for Unity and would like to discuss migrating your project to SpatialOS running on zeuz, please contact us at migration@improbable.io before 30th December 2021. 

* If you would like to start development of your game on SpatialOS and would like access to the latest version of the GDK for Unity and are not currently using SpatialOS please contact us at [ims.improbable.io/contact](ims.improbable.io/contact) with details about your project.
