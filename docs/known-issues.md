| IL2CPP does not currently work on Mac as it crashes upon starting the game. This is due to a bug in Unity that does not initialize a system correctly, if one of the injected `IComponentData` contains a `long`.                                                                                                            | 2018/08/31 | 1076596                                                                                                | Use the Mono compiler.                                                |
