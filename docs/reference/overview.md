# Overview

### New to the GDK?

If you are new to the GDK, the best place to start is with the [Get started]({{urlRoot}}/projects/fps/get-started/get-started) guide. This guides you through setting up SpatialOS with Unity using the FPS Starter Project, which you can use as both a learning tool and a starter for your own game.

### SpatialOS concepts

If you are new to SpatialOS, you can check out the SpatialOS concept documentation on the SpatialOS [main documentation site](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/concepts/spatialos).

### Where to start with the GDK reference documentation

We recommend you take a look at the following three pages first:

* The introduction to the two workflows: [the MonoBehaviour and ECS Workflows]({{urlRoot}}/reference/workflows/overview.md). <br/>
You can choose to work with either the traditional Unity MonoBehaviour approach or the new Unity Entity Component System (ECS) approach.

* The background document on [workers in the GDK]({{urlRoot}}/reference/concepts/worker.md).

* The guide on [how to create SpatialOS entity templates]({{urlRoot}}/reference/concepts/entity-templates.md).

### Workflows

#### MonoBehaviour

If you are using the MonoBehaviour workflow, you should look at [the GameObject Creation Feature Module]({{urlRoot}}/modules/game-object-creation/overview) documentation to learn how to link GameObjects to SpatialOS entities.

#### ECS

The GDK currently uses Unity's `0.0.12-preview.18` version of the entities preview packages. This GDK documentation assumes you are familiar with the Unity Entity Component System (ECS).

For information on the ECS system, see:

* This overview [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U9wRgQyy6s) from [Brackeys](http://brackeys.com/).
* The more detailed documentation from Unity on the [ECS GitHub repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/blob/master/Documentation/index.md).
