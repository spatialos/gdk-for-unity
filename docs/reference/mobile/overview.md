# Mobile Support Overview

Before starting with mobile development, make sure you are familiar with

  * [The SpatialOS GDK for Unity](\{\{urlRoot\}\}/reference/overview)
  * [The different workflows](\{\{urlRoot\}\}/reference/workflows/which-workflow)
  * [Workers in the GDK](\{\{urlRoot\}\}/reference/concepts/worker)

## Developing SpatialOS games for Android and iOS

The SpatialOS GDK for Unity contains a [mobile feature module]({{urlRoot}}/modules/core-and-feature-module-overview#mobile-support-module) which enables you to develop games for Android and iOS. SpatialOS games are cross-platform by default, so Android, iOS, PC, Xbox One and PS4 users can play together in the same deployment.

All feature modules work with mobile devices.
