# Overview

### New to the GDK?
If you are new to the GDK, the best place to start is with the [welcome]({{urlRoot}}/welcome) page. This will get you started using SpatialOS with Unity. After this, check out the [starter projects]({{urlRoot}}/projects/template-fps/overview) which you can use as both tutorials and a starter for your own game (under our [Improbable license]({{urlRoot}}/license.md)).

### SpatialOS concepts

If you are new to SpatialOS, you can check out the SpatialOS concept documentation on the SpatialOS [main documentation site](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/concepts/spatialos).


### Where to start with the GDK reference documentation

We recommend you take a look at the following three pages first:

* The introduction to the two workflows: [the GameObject-MonoBehaviour and ECS Workflows]({{urlRoot}}/content/intro-workflows-spatialos-entities.md). <br/>
You can choose to work with either the traditional Unity GameObject and MonoBehaviour approach or the new Unity Entity Component System (ECS) approach.

* The background document on [workers in the GDK]({{urlRoot}}/content/workers/workers-in-the-gdk.md).

* The guide on [how to create SpatialOS entity templates]({{urlRoot}}/content/entity-templates.md).

### Workflows

#### GameObject-MonoBehaviour

If you are using the GameObject-MonoBehaviour workflow, you should look at [How to link SpatialOS entities with GameObjects]({{urlRoot}}/content/gameobject/linking-spatialos-entities.md), once you have looked at the above three documents.

#### ECS 

The GDK currently uses Unity's 0.0.12-preview.13 version of the entities preview packages. This GDK documentation assumes you are familiar with the Unity Entity Component System (ECS).

For information on the ECS system, see:

* This overview [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U9wRgQyy6s) from [Brackeys](http://brackeys.com/).
* The more detailed documentation from Unity on the [ECS GitHub repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/blob/master/Documentation/index.md).
