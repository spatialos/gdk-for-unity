## Developing SpatialOS games for Android and iOS

The SpatialOS GDK for Unity contains a [mobile feature module]({{urlRoot}}/content/modules/core-and-feature-module-overview#mobile-support-module) which enables you to develop games for Android and iOS. SpatialOS games are cross-platform by default, so Android, iOS, PC, Xbox One and PS4 users can play together in the same deployment.

All feature modules work with mobile devices.
