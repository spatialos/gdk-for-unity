# Mobile Support Overview

Before starting with mobile development, make sure you are familiar with

  * [The SpatialOS GDK for Unity]({{urlRoot}}/content/intro-reference)
  * [The different workflows]({{urlRoot}}/content/intro-workflows-spatialos-entities)
  * [Workers in the GDK]({{urlRoot}}/content/workers/workers-in-the-gdk)

## Developing SpatialOS games for Android and iOS

We provide a feature module for the SpatialOS GDK for Unity to allow you to develop games for Android and iOS. This allows you to build [client-workers]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#client-worker) for different platforms that can all connect to the same deployment and enables you to create cross-platform games.  All current feature modules are supported and work with mobile devices.
